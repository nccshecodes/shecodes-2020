  I'm one of a small but growing contingent of people over the age of 40, who've
  made significant career changes to break into the UK tech industry. My first
  developer role at the start of 2018 was also my first ’employed’ position in
  22 years. This made me a firm advocate not only for women returners but also
  career changers looking to make the switch into tech.

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>
  There was never a grand plan to become a developer, it just happened. I was
  juggling being mum with working from home at the time when small businesses
  really needed to have an online presence to survive. We needed a website for
  our home business and we didn't have a budget to pay a professional. So I sat
  at the kitchen table, ploughed my way through tutorial after tutorial and built
  my first website. It seemed a pretty good fit to upskills my graphics background
  and for some reason I enjoyed pulling my hair out night after night, just for
  that one moment when finally, the code would just work. Over time I started
  building sites for friends and local small businesses, winning two awards for
  a responsive website.
</p>

<p>
  Then I watched the BBC Girls Can Code and that changed everything. I wanted to be
  working in a tech startup. So I formed food tech startup TreatOut in September
  2015 bagging a place on the Google Campus for Mums Startup Programme.
</p>

<p>
  The startup gained attention very early on, and with it an invitation to go pitch
  at the Seeds&Chips food summit in Milan. A judge asked me "Why
  is it that you can build websites, but you're not building the app?". It was
  a damn good question that wouldn't stop niggling and pushed me to go apply to a
  fullstack coding bootcamp at Le Wagon. In summer 2016 I joined the first London
  cohort batch #36, and became the technical co-founder at TreatOut.
</p>

<h2>Since then</h2>
<p>
  I spent the next 6 months back at home building out an MVP. But I missed being
  at bootcamp and decided that the only way to really step up to a technical
  co-founder, was to go and get a job as a developer. So I did.
</p>
<p>
  It was hard work getting that first junior position at Skills Matter, the
  recruitment process was and still is very broken. But just at the point of
  giving up, the offer came through for my first (what recruiters would consider)
  commercial role in over 20 years.
</p>

<h2>And now</h2>
<p>
  It's 2020 and I'm half way through my third year of working in tech. I've stepped
  away from working fullstack to focus on Front End development and enjoying life
  as a Software Engineer at Zoopla.
</p>
<p>
  Lockdown and a return to working from home has given me extra time to keep
  learning. I've decided to concentrate for now on accessibility, and with a little
  influence from some of my colleagues, I've started looking at web performance too.
</p>
<p>
  The startup journey was not easy and I made the difficult decision to resign
  from TreatOut in May 2019. I gathered my thoughts rebranding as myFeastOut and
  gave myself time to recover from burnout. Perhaps I'll pick
  up the project again, but I'm not there yet.
</p>
<p>
  In the meantime, I write about the journey of making the transition from a solo,
  self-taught coder to professional software engineer and who knows, maybe even
  a startup founder with a day job again too.
