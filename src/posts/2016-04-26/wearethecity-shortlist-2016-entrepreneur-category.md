## Humbled to be shortlisted for the Entrepreneur Category

It’s been another exciting start to the week. I’ve been shortlisted as co-founder of TreatOut for the WeAretheCity Top 100 Rising Star Awards 2016 Entrepreneur Category.

The WATC Rising Star Awards are the first to focus on the UK’s female talent pipeline below management level and celebrates 100 individual female contributors representing the leaders and role models of tomorrow.

The awards are now in their second term and with over 950 nominations spanning across the UK and Northern Ireland, the number of entries received are treble that of last year. {.pullquote}

I’m really looking forward to attending the shortlisted celebration event sponsored by Bloomberg on the 17 May 2016. To have come this far since founding TreatOut in September is breathtaking. I feel both humbled and inspired to be listed amongst such a wealth of talented women.

I’m acutely aware of the lack of relatable, ground level role models, especially for women in tech. I sincerely hope that (together with my fellow co-founders Tracey and Deborah without whom none of this would be possible) our example will encourage other women to find courage and not think they’re ‘too old’ to make a move into the technology sector. It is a huge learning curve, but such a diverse, challenging and rewarding career path to take. You certainly don’t have to be a techie to be in tech.

The shortlist is now open to public vote before the set of expert judges select the final winners to be announced on 6 June.
