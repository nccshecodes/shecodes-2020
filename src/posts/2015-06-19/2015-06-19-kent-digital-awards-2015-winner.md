## A Golden Night Out

It was an absolute pleasure to accompany Darenth Valley Golf Course to the Kent Digital Awards 2015 last night, and I must admit we were just a little bit excited to be attending as finalists in two categories.

First up was the Responsive Website Category. We have worked hard to deliver a seamless web experience to Darenth Valley Golfers whether checking the site at home, or on the go. The response we’ve received since the site’s launch in February has been tremendously positive, and we were delighted to be awarded Silver.

Next category was for best Sports and Entertainment Website. This included looking at web design, development, cross-platform accessibility and user experience. The attention to detail that was put into the site build paid off, and we were thrilled to come away with the Gold Award.

There’s no greater reward than seeing a client so delighted, not only with the tangible business results the site has already brought in, but to have industry recognition alongside is an incredible buzz. Luckily I’d selected my handbag wisely and it was just large enough to fit both awards into for the taxi ride home.

## Getting Set For Next Year
But the fun didn’t stop there, and today has been a full day geek fest at the Responsive Day Out 3 Conference. With a big grin still firmly in place, it’s been an inspiring day in Brighton swatting up on the latest web developments and what the future web may bring.

Just a shame the shops had shut before I could grab a bigger handbag ready for next year’s awards.
