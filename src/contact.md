I'm not currently accepting contract work, but if you want to chat about startups, learning to code or making a career change into tech, please do get in touch. I've had a lot of help and advice along the way and although it might take me a little while to reply, if I can pass that advice on, I will.

You can send me an email to <a href="mailto:nathalie@shecodes.co.uk" title="send me an email directly from your mail client" class="email">nathalie@shecodes.co.uk</a> or if it's easier, I'm usually around on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/she_codes" title="my twitter profile">@shecodes</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shecodes/">LinkedIn</a>.

I still have a lot to learn about accessibility and performance so if you spot something I could be doing better, please do let me know!
