Nathalie has spent the past three years working on an ambitious tech project and she's been told she’ll fail. Why? "Because it’s too hard. Because it’s too big a problem to solve." She has been told to simplify, to get data on board quickly, to create the illusion of success to gain market traction. You're all busy in the tech industry building products that pull data in and spit data out that people, your customers, use to make informed choices on a daily basis.
