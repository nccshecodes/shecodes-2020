A designer who can code is considered a unicorn. As someone making that transition Nathalie is often quizzed - “Just how tricky is it to switch from designer to developer?” Admittedly, Nathalie sometimes feels more pantomime donkey (with very wobbly back end legs).

With that in mind, this talk is an introduction into how developers can firm up their front legs and discover a love for design. Forget the fluff and abstract theories, this gets straight to the heart of how to take the structured principles of design and translate them into logical processes.

Come away with ideas on how to keep frontend frameworks in their place, breathe personality into a project, and think like a designer. Get ready to toss away that pantomime donkey and rock the unicorn look.
