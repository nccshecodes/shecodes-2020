I am no expert on the subject of Design Systems but what I am, is bilingual. I grew up in graphics and design was my first language. I moved to development and lived here long enough to start dreaming in code.
What I am is an interpreter fast becoming adept at catching the subtle nuances easily lost in translation, acting as a go-between when designs are switched to code.
