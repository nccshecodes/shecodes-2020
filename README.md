## SheCodes 2020

I'm focussing this year on learning about accessibility ([thanks to W3C and EdX](https://www.edx.org/course/web-accessibility-introduction)), web performance ([courtesy of smashing magazine and Harry Roberts](https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/workshops/harry-roberts)), and eleventy ([thanks Andy Bell!](https://piccalil.li/course/learn-eleventy-from-scratch/)), setting out with basic or zero knowledge on each subject beforehand.

This project is a complete overhaul of my existing personal website built in Wordpress. There's lots of features not being used, a CMS is definitely overkill for what I need and I'm tired of chasing updates to keep the site locked down and secure. Intention is to improve security, up my accessibility game and start thinking about performance.
